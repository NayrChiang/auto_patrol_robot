# Autonomous Patrol Robot

## Short Description

An autonomous patrol robot system that navigates through predefined waypoints using ROS 2 Navigation2, captures images at checkpoints, and provides real-time status updates. Built with comprehensive sensor integration (LIDAR, IMU, camera) and full Gazebo simulation support.
